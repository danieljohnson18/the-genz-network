### Design Consistency

All new sections maintain the Ford Foundation design system:
- Oswald font for headings

- Square corners, no border-radius
- 2px borders on buttons
- Simple hover effects
- Clean, minimal aesthetic

## To View

The dev server should already be running at: **http://localhost:3000**

If not:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## All Content Sections

The landing page is now much more substantial with:
- 1 hero section
- 1 mission statement
- 3 featured content cards
- 6 program cards
- 9 priority area cards
- 4 impact statistics
- 6 news/story cards

This gives users much more to explore and makes the page feel complete and professional.
